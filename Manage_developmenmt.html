                required of managers because complex financial dealings are the
                order of the day, the course enables participants to monitor and
                evaluate people, processes, and technology in enhancing their
                financial safeguards.

                <p>
                  The most important resource in any Organisation is widely
                  believed to be its Human Resources. Attaining Organisational
                  goals and importantly a Purpose is largely depending on human
                  talents and their possibilities. These being available on
                  their own is however not sufficient enough to bring about
                  desired levels of Performance. This resource needs to be led
                  intentionally toward both the short and longer terms. Hence
                  Tactical understanding and deliberate guidance and enhancement
                  of human resources in an Organisation can be said to be a
                  critical activity

                  This course, therefore, enables deliberate and strategic
                  channelling of people in Organisations, their behaviours, and
                  contributions towards the maximal yielding of potential and
                  Talent. This in-depth program aims to sharpen the
                  organizational skills of talent development professionals, to
                  enable them to plan effectively and coordinate training and
                  human development events. It will also give human resource
                  managers a means of identifying causes of workers’
                  inefficiency and adopting modern technology and other
                  traditional models in phasing out barriers to work performance
                  and productive culture.

                <p>
                  This program has a tripartite feature with not less than 12
                  different courses and they ensure delegates understand the
                  critical role of projects and project Agents / Managers,
                  having ideal approaches in Organisations. Present-day
                  Organisational demands require and expect employees, and
                  Managers to take on multiple assignments, and to get those
                  done well, under budget, and on time. Participants in this
                  course will be exposed to areas such as overall time plans,
                  project governance and business cases, and managing various
                  stakeholders amongst many other things. The need to create a
                  basis/business case and build a project time plan toward
                  achieving these are central to Organisational life. Critical
                  path analysis, assigning and managing resources, establishing
                  project gates, controls, and milestones within set timelines,
                  and achieving KPIs are central and essential to Organisations’
                  performances

                  Besides the project aspects of this program, procurement
                  courses also give this program a boost in which our past
                  participants did attest to the usefulness of courses like
                  effective supply chain management, building business
                  relationships through procurement, and warehouse management to
                  their work and professional development. The contracting arm
                  of this program broadens participants’ knowledge of Contract
                  Management, as well as helps delegates acquire special skills
                  in the field. The course also helps participants build
                  networks and allows managers, Practitioners, and focused
                  persons to enhance themselves and in so doing, such persons
                  looking to promote their careers.

                  leaders, and public / government or private sector employees
                  to enhance themselves and their leadership skills, thus

                  geared to help such high-potential employee skill enhancement
                  in three areas – leading self, leading others, and leading the
                  future. Participants thus can learn from experts, benchmark
                  with others and widen their knowledge, and experiences. This
                  program includes courses that teach practices that perfect the
                  art of etiquette and international protocols in the
                  organisation, strengthen the skills and competencies of senior
                  management, and provide service excellence in public
                  administration and leadership for senior officials.

                  <h3>Program 10: Anti-Corruption</h3>
                  <p>
                    Arguably, Corruption can be said to hinder sustainable
                    development in countries. This program aims at strengthening
                    the competencies required for overcoming some of the
                    challenges to combat corruption, its causes, and
                    consequences for sustainable development. The course also
                    tries to understand the benefits of promoting its
                    prevention. Also, its relationship to development, the rule
                    of law, and human rights are highlighted in the course. To
                    tackle its root causes and consequences as well as to find
                    solutions for prevention, accountability, and redress, the
                    impact of mainstreaming knowledge is a powerful approach
                    towards transforming the lives of individuals and societies
                    as a whole.
